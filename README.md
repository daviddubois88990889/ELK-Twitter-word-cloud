# ELK-Twitter-word-cloud
Using ELK create a word cloud with the most talked about subjects on twitter

Starting with the ELK Engine from https://github.com/GISDev01/tweets-nlp-elasticsearch

Take the projest a little further and extract subjects from TextBlob using the noun phases and create 
a new repository to record the record the subjects as they come in.

Then using Kibana's tag cloud display the top 100 subjects on twitter today.
